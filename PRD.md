The design should evoke **professional sophistication and technical precision** - clean, minimalist, and modern with surgical attention to detail that demonstrates mastery of contemporary web standards. A minimal interface better serves the core purpose by eliminating distractions and focusing attention on technical competency demonstration.

## Color Selection

**Complementary** - Using sophisticated contrast between deep, professional primary colors and bright, strategic accent colors to create visual hierarchy and guide attention to key elements.

- **Primary Color**: Deep Charcoal `oklch(0.25 0.02 240)` - Communicates technical depth, professionalism, and modern sophistication
- **Secondary Colors**: Neutral Gray `oklch(0.65 0.01 240)` for supporting text and subtle backgrounds, Pure White `oklch(1 0 0)` for maximum contrast areas
- **Accent Color**: Electric Blue `oklch(0.7 0.15 240)` - Attention-grabbing highlight for CTAs, active states, and key interactive elements
- **Foreground/Background Pairings**: 
  - Background (Pure White #FFFFFF): Charcoal text `oklch(0.25 0.02 240)` - Ratio 11.2:1 ✓
  - Card (Light Gray `oklch(0.98 0.005 240)`): Charcoal text `oklch(0.25 0.02 240)` - Ratio 10.8:1 ✓
  - Primary (Deep Charcoal `oklch(0.25 0.02 240)`): White text `oklch(1 0 0)` - Ratio 11.2:1 ✓
  - Accent (Electric Blue `oklch(0.7 0.15 240)`): White text `oklch(1 0 0)` - Ratio 7.1:1 ✓

## Font Selection

Typography should convey **technical precision and contemporary professionalism** using Inter for its excellent screen readability and modern, neutral character that works across all contexts from technical documentation to executive presentations.

- **Typographic Hierarchy**: 
  - H1 (Hero Title): Inter Bold/48px/tight letter spacing (-0.02em)
  - H2 (Section Headers): Inter SemiBold/32px/normal letter spacing
  - H3 (Project Titles): Inter Medium/24px/normal letter spacing  
  - Body Text: Inter Regular/16px/relaxed line height (1.6)
  - Technical Labels: Inter Medium/14px/wide letter spacing (0.05em)

## Animations

**Contextually appropriate micro-interactions** that enhance usability without calling attention to themselves - the balance heavily favors subtle functionality over moments of delight, with motion used primarily to communicate state changes and guide user attention through complex technical information.

- **Purposeful Meaning**: Smooth scrolling and subtle hover states reinforce the technical precision brand while page transitions provide spatial continuity
- **Hierarchy of Movement**: Primary CTAs receive gentle scaling on hover, project cards get subtle elevation changes, and navigation elements use understated color transitions

## Component Selection

- **Components**: Shadcn Card components for project showcases, Form components for contact functionality, Button variants for hierarchical CTAs, Badge components for technology tags
- **Customizations**: Custom project showcase grid with responsive masonry layout, animated skill category filters, progressive image loading for project screenshots

- **Icon Selection**: Phosphor Icons for their technical aesthetic - Terminal for code links, Eye for live demos, ArrowUpRight for external links, Envelope for contact
